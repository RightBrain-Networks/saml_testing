saml_testing
============

Both ruby-saml-idp-rails3-aexample and ruby-saml-rails3-example are repos
copied from drnic (@6b908065b8 and @988ffd581b respectively). They can be
used to set up an IdP/SP pair for testig SAML v2 SSO.

ruby-saml-idp-rails-example has been changed to pull users from a db for
a little more flexible testing.
